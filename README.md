# grphp - gRPC PHP Framework

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bigcommerce/grphp.svg?token=D3Cc4LCF9BgpUx4dpPpv&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/bigcommerce/grphp)

grphp is a PHP framework that wraps the [gRPC PHP library](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/php) to
provide a more streamlined integration into PHP applications.

It provides an abstracted client for gRPC services, along with other tools to help get gRPC services in PHP
up fast and efficiently at scale. Some of its features include:

* Robust client error handling and metadata transport abilities
* Interceptor support and insertion-order maintained registry
* Server authentication support, with basic auth with multiple key support built in
* Error data serialization in output metadata to allow fine-grained error handling in the transport while still 
preserving gRPC BadStatus codes
* Client execution timings in responses

grphp currently has active support for gRPC 1.3-1.6, and requires 7.0+ to run.

## Installation

```bash
composer require bigcommerce/grphp
```

You'll need to make sure you fit [the requirements for the grpc/grpc PHP library](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/php#environment),
which does involve installing the gRPC PHP extension.

## Client

```php
$config = new Grphp\Client\Config();
$config->setHostname('IP_OF_SERVER:PORT');
$client = new Grphp\Client(Things\ThingsClient::class, $config);

$request = new Things\GetThingReq();
$request->setId(1234);

$resp = $client->call($request, 'GetThing');
$thing = $resp->getResponse(); // Things\Thing
echo $thing->id; // 1234
echo $resp->getStatusCode(); // 0 (these are gRPC status codes)
echo $resp->getStatusDetails(); // OK
``` 

### Custom Client Interceptors

grphp comes with a base Client Interceptor class that can be extended to provide your own custom interceptors. 
This is an example interceptor that adds a "X-Foo" header with a customizable value to all metadata:

```php
<?php
use Grphp\Client\Response;
use Grphp\Client\Interceptors\Base as BaseInterceptor;

class FooHeader extends BaseInterceptor
{
    /**
     * @param callable $callback
     * @return Response
     */
    public function call(callable $callback)
    {
        // set outgoing metadata
        $this->metadata['stuff'] = ['my_thing'];
        // make the outbound call
        /** @var Response $response */
        $response = $callback();  
        // adjust incoming metadata        
        $response->setMetadata([
            'X-Foo' => $this->options['foo_value'],
        ]);
        return $response;
    }
}
```

You'll note that you have to make sure to execute the callback that is called.

Then you add it as normal:

```php
$i = new FooInterceptor(['foo_value' => 'bar']);
$client->interceptors->add($i);
```

Interceptors run in the order that they are added, wrapping each as they go.

## Authentication

Authentication is done via interceptors. Currently grphp has Basic auth out of the box.

### Basic Authentication

grphp supports basic auth for requests that is sent through the metadata of the request. 

```php
$client = new Grphp\Client(Things\ThingsClient::class, $config);
$client->interceptors->add(Grphp\Client\Interceptors\Authentication\Basic([
    'username' => 'foo',
    'password' => 'bar', // optional
]));
```

## Error Handling

gRPC prefers handling errors through status (BadStatus) codes; however, these do not return much information as to 
field specific errors, application codes, or debug information. grphp provides a way to read data from the response 
metadata, which is stored in the `error-internal-bin` key.

Assuming we have a service that has a method that appends that data, you can access it like so:

```php
try {
    $resp = $client->call($request, 'GetErroringMethod');
    
} catch (\Grphp\Client\Error $e) {
    $trailer = $e->getTrailer();
    var_dump($trailer); // ['message' => 'Foo']
}
```

By default the deserializer for the data is JSON; it's fairly simple to create your own, such as one that has the error 
header serialized as a binary protobuf. From there, you can set it simply:

```php
class MyProtoSerializer extends Grphp\Serializers\Errors\Base
{
    public function deserialize($trailer)
    {
        $header = new \My\Proto\ErrorHeader();
        $header->mergeFromString($trailer);
        return $header;
    }
}

$config = new Grphp\Client\Config();
$config->setHostname('IP_OF_SERVER:PORT');
$config->setErrorSerializer(new MyProtoSerializer());
```

## Roadmap

* Add TLS configuration support
